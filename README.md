# The-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions
Game Off 2022 Submission

I am new in game development and still learning, I thought following youtube tutorials and then branch out from that, I will be making something new,
but I took a long time in the learning process,
I learnt about finite state machine, and it took me a week to fully understand the concepts, with the inheritance of the classes, set state, enter/exit state,
and transition, there was a lot of things to put together and figure out how it was actually working.

Then there was navigation where the enemies will follow the player, from the tutorial which I was following, some of the function were obsolete,
 Godot introduced new Navigation system, I have to learn and follow the documentation for the it, this also took me a week to figure out how,
Navigation Polygon Instance, Navigation Agent and Navigation 2D node work together.

Then I was introduced to Procedural Generation for my rogue like dungeon, it also took a while not only to build the different levels but to understand the how it works.

After making my game, I encountered bugs, which were mostly off placement of tiles, this made the game look like as if puzzle pieces were scrambled all over 
the place and I have to redesign my level to make pixel perfect with respect to the origin.

I wanted to be a part of this game jam, thats why I submitted this project, even though its the most unoriginal game out there, but I had fun making it
and looking forward to learn more, I hope that next year I will be making a good game, for now this is the best I can do.

Thank you.
